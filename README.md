# Introduction
This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that focuses on analyzing the sentiment of text data using natural language processing techniques. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the sentiment or emotional tone expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we'll explore how to perform sentiment analysis using Python and popular NLP libraries. In this Project, Azure cloud services have been used (Azure Data Studio, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cognitive Services).

Sentiment analysis has numerous applications across various industries, such as marketing, customer service, social media monitoring, and more. This project aims to provide a practical implementation of sentiment analysis using pre-trained language models and showcases its potential to understand and categorize the sentiment behind a piece of text.

# Input 
In the input Folder, the Action_movies.csv is the basic file that has movie metadata with its revies Url.
